- probably need to set playerIdx in     def getPlayerStateAtBirth(self, playerIdx):  (or otherwise, do not even have that field?)
- recheck that there's enough room to compute all getInitSkills !



- I think we need nDisions (new and old) => probably we need all of that as old/new
- I would swear I need the prevShirtNumber besides prevTeam in playerState... how do I find skills otherwise?

- check when player has been transfered to the same league, or back and from to the same league.

- double check <= in getLastestSkills:    newest = 0 < self.timeZoneUpdates[timeZone].updateCycleIdx <= pylio.cycleIdx(15,0)
- also double check if the player has been sold before any round: is the prevPlayedTeamIdx updated? (we wouldn't want)
        if self.timeZoneUpdates[timeZone].isJustCreated() and playerState.prevPlayedTeamIdx == 0:
            return self.getPlayerSkillsAtBirth(playerIdx)

- check what happens when asking for playerSkills between OpenMarket and NewOrgMap, in terms of asking for the correct map

- "I need to implement getInitSkills after round 1 for a given timezone"
- "player evolution through a round by playing games"

- issue: if can 2 bots eventually be created equally? currently yes. Imagine a league in DIV = 2. The first bot. It is then taken by someone who eventually goes to Limbo => BOTS should use "round" as seed. The worse is its playerIDX.



- move TZ_IDX_DRAW_NEXT_LEAGUES... etc to a function:
	day, turnInDay => cycleIdx

- add divisions + 10 in orgChart

verseToTimeZone: timeZone, posInTimeZone = f(verse) used by currentTimeZone... used by nobody


- when a country or a division is created, teams are assigned automatically, so no need for orgChart update



- maybe repeated: getLeagueIdxInCountryFromTeamIdxInCountry?


- updateCycleIdx needs not be written, can be computed on the fly?
- check all use of deployTimeInSecsOfADay
- remove Country.timeZone
- some isPlayerTransferable went from isPlayerBusy, which is the oppostite!
- use timestamp
- replace python int() by //

why do we need this in each slash? Is not a slash followed by a write()?
	         self.lastWriteBlocknum          = blocknum # toni (needed?)



- we should disallow leagues to be created in the past, and test usersAlong...
