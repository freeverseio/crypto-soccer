Lionel4 python:

fix shirtNum vs playerPosInTeam, one has a meaning that is invariant under tactics...
replace MinimalPlayerState by genome vs temp
check that skills -> state is only used when really needed
update help lines from states to skills
do we need to recheck that the leaf is as expected all the time?
I think that neededHashes contain the root too, not needed.

General doubt: currently, verifyMerkleTree receives the leaf-prehash. In general, I think that we wouldn't need it, but rather, pass the hash of the leaf directly...

Make it all with MerkleTrees
	=> it may require storing the tree in the ST_CLIENT to produce the proofs?

todo: leagueRoot not needed in dataToChallengeLeague
just like I have dataToChallengeLeague, do I need dataToChallengeSuperoot, et?
